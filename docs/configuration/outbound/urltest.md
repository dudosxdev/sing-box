### Fields

#### outbounds

==Required==

List of outbound tags to test.

#### url

The URL to test. `https://www.gstatic.com/generate_204` will be used if empty.

#### interval

The test interval. `3m` will be used if empty.

#### unavailable_check_interval

The delay before a one-shot recheck for a specific outbound after it becomes unavailable from real traffic. `2s` will be used if empty.

Only the unavailable outbound is re-tested once. If it recovers, its URLTest history is refreshed immediately and the group selection is recalculated without waiting for the next regular `interval`.

#### tolerance

The test tolerance in milliseconds. `50` will be used if empty.

#### idle_timeout

The idle timeout. `30m` will be used if empty.

#### interrupt_exist_connections

Interrupt existing connections when the selected outbound has changed.

Only inbound connections are affected by this setting, internal connections will always be interrupted.
